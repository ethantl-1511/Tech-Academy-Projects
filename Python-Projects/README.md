<h2>Student-Tracking Program</h2>
<p>This project keeps a database of student's information and what courses they attend at a school. A user can add a new student's name, number, email, and current course attending to the database, and also delete students from the database as needed. They can then see their entry in a large scrollable list.</p>

<h2>File-Transfer Program</h2>
<p>This project program will check a chosen source directory and move all new files created within the last 24 hours to a chosen destination directory all with the click of a button!</p>

<h2>Django Projects</h2>
<p>The first Django project involved creating an admin section of a Unviersity site that could be used to add Professors and other Campuses to a database.</p>
<p>The second Django project involved creating a site where you could create an account, input a deposit or withdrawl, and see account-related balances.</p>
