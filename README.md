# Tech Academy Projects
 
This repository features all of the projects and programs created during my time at The Tech Academy's Software Developer boot camp. 

Course work included learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, Python, and C# to develop a large variety of front-end and back-end development skills. Projects include simple websites, browser-based games, SQL databases, desktop applications and simple console-games, and database-driven MVC web-applications.
